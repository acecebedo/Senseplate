# senseplate
2nd year project work

app created on MIT app inventor is unfinished and the following functionality  below is missing:
- search functionality to query database (instead a makeshift database was made inside the app block; which contains only 20 specific items)
- final calorie calculation method (because i couldnt figure out how to convert byte text recieved from esp32 to integer so that i can multiply weight to calorie information stored)

esp32 arduino code includes comments
